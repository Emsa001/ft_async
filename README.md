## Introduction
The Async Task Manager is designed to help you manage asynchronous tasks in your C projects. It provides a simple interface to create and manage tasks, ensuring thread safety and efficient task execution.
## Features
- **Easy Async Management**: Create, start, and manage async tasks with a simple function.
- **Thread Safety**: Ensures safe execution and ending of tasks across multiple threads.
- **Customizable Task Functions**: Define your own start, process, and end functions for tasks.
## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/emsa001/ft_async.git
    cd ft_async
    ```

2. **Build the project**:
    ```sh
    make
    ```

3. **Run the project**:
    ```sh
    make run
    ```
## Usage

Here's a quick overview of how to use the Async Task Manager:

1. **Create a new async task**:
    ```c
    t_async *async = new_async();
    async->time = 10000; // Task duration in milliseconds
    async->start = &start;
    async->process = &process;
    async->process_time = 10; // Process interval in milliseconds
    async->end = &end;
    async->end_main = &end_main; // Will run function at the end of the async in main thread
    start_async(async);
    ```

    ```c
    void ft_wait_end(void *arg) {
        printf("Executed with ft_wait! - Wow this is so easy!\n");
    }

    ft_wait(1000, &ft_wait_end); // Will execute function ft_wait_end in a main thread after 1000 ms
    ```

2. **Define your task functions**:
    ```c
    void start(t_async *async) {
        printf("start thread %d\n", async->id);
    }

    void process(t_async *async) {
        int time_left = async->time - async->time_elapsed;
        printf("process thread %d: %d\n", async->id, time_left);
    }

    void end(t_async *async) {
        printf("end thread: %d\n", async->id);
    }

    void end_main(void *arg) {
        printf("This was executed by the main thread!\n");
    }
    ```

4. **Clean up at program exit**:
    ```c
    destroy_manager();
    ```
